## About

This particular app feature 5 panels spanning across the screen, stacked horzontally. When the user clicks on one of the panels, that particular panel will expand, taking 1/3 of the screen. When the transition completes, that panel's upper and lower text then slides into view. In other words, cool stuff! 

## Key Lessons

In this project, I learned how to ...

```
work with flex boxes, transitions, and transforms,
understand how flex works across different elements (this was a huge take-away for me),
how to incorporate JavaScript to toggle classes when a specific action occurs.
```
